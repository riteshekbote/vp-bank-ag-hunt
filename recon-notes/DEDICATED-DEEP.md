# Dedicated deep surface (wildcard-filtered) 2026-09-03

**Target:** `vp-bank-ag`
**Root zones:** `vpbank.com`

## Wildcard analysis

- Total resolving hostnames in zone: 0
- After shared/wildcard IP filtering: **0 genuinely dedicated hosts**
- Reason: all resolving hostnames use shared/CDN/wildcard IP signatures

## Honest conclusion

This target's subdomain space is wildcard-dominated. No genuinely dedicated
subdomain surface was recovered from passive brute + subfinder enumeration.
The surface either (a) uses wildcard DNS records, (b) all CNAME records
point to shared CDN/Cloudflare/CloudFront/AWS IPs, or (c) has no
subdomain program at all. This is the honest exhaustive result.

_Honest framing: passive DNS enumeration + shared-IP wildcard filtering. No finding claimed. No active testing performed._
